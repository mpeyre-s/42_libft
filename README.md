# ➡️ Competencies Acquired

- **Recreation of Standard Library Functions**: Mastery of fundamental C programming concepts by reimplementing essential functions from the C standard library, such as `atoi`, `strlcat`, `calloc` and much more like `split`, `strtrim`...

- **Memory Management**: Deep understanding of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring efficient use of resources and avoiding memory leaks.

- **Pointer Manipulation**: Proficiency in working with pointers, including pointer arithmetic, double pointers, and their use in dynamic data structures.

- **Custom Data Structures**: Development of custom data structures, such as linked lists, to manage and organize data effectively.

- **Linked List Implementation**: Practical experience in creating and manipulating linked lists, including node creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Modular Code Design**: Ability to write modular, reusable, and well-structured code, adhering to strict coding standards.

- **Debugging and Testing**: Strengthened debugging and testing skills, ensuring the reliability and robustness of implemented functions.
